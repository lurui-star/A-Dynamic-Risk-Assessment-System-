# Risk Assessment ML Model: Scoring and Monitoring

## Description
This project is part of **Unit 5: Machine Learning Model Scoring and Monitoring**. The objective is to create, deploy, and monitor a **risk assessment ML model** designed to estimate the attrition risk of each client within a company. Additionally, it involves setting up processes for:

- **Re-training** the model as new data becomes available
- **Re-deploying** the model to production
- **Monitoring** model performance over time
- **Reporting** on model outcomes

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3**: This project is built with Python 3.
- **Linux Environment (WSL)**: If you are using Windows, a Linux environment may be required through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Dependencies
All required dependencies for the project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Ensure that you have these dependencies installed to properly run the project.

## Installation
To install the dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended to avoid conflicts with other projects):
    - For example, using `venv`:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
      - On Linux/Mac:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
      - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

2. **Install the dependencies** using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can begin working with the risk assessment model. Refer to the specific sections of the project for instructions on how to create, deploy, monitor, and report on the model.
